How to generate a JEE EPP with Bluemix tools.
1. Download JEE EPP and extract it.
2. Use p2 director to install Bluemix tools to it.
3. Zip it up.
4. Do some smoke testing - ensure that Bluemix Tools Welcome page shows up 
   when starting for the first time. 

Experiences with p2 Director
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
eclipsec.exe -noSplash -consoleLog -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -repository http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/updates/cloud/V105 -installIU com.ibm.cftools.feature.feature.group,com.ibm.websphere.wdt.server.tools.feature.group -tag AddBluemixTools -destination c:\Eclipse\tmp\eclipse\ -profile epp.package.jee

Used it as a runtime app to debug issues better. Here are the set of problems
encountered and their solutions:
* The first problem was a typo in the destination. 
* Next problem was to figure out the "IU" ids that need to be passed to 
  "-installIU". Need to refer to the content.jar in the repository to get this 
  info. Typicallly this ends with ".feature.group". 
* The next problem was that it was not picking up existing plugins, instead 
  trying to install the full platform all over again. This is because the 
  JEE EPP Package had its own profile (instead of the standard SDKProfile). 
* Finally, the IUs for Bluemix Tools and Liberty Tools need to be explicitly 
  mentioned to get both of them installed. 

TODO Tasks
1. A script to download JEE EPP package.
2. Unzip the package.
3. Use p2 from the same JEE EPP

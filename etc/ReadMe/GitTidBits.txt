1. To rename the folder name of a plugin, do it from Bash - EGit won't do.
   Use "git mv name new-name"

2. To create a patch between current branch (which is checked out), and 
   another branch, use "git diff <another-branch>" and redirect to patch file.
   Use "git diff HEAD^ HEAD" to create a patch for the last commit.

3. To accept changes from main to dev branch, you can either use merge or 
   rebase: 
	git checkout dev
	git merge master
   or
	git merge master dev

   Rebase is done as follows:
	git checkout feature
	git rebase master
   Use the "-i" option to rebase to perform an interactive rebase. With
   interactive rebase, you can pick / combine individual merges.
   
   Typically merging is recommended over rebase. If the branch is to be 
   eventually merged to the main branch, then use rebase to incorporate
   intermediate changes from master and then finally merge it to master.

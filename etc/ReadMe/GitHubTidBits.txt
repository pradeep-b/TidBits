GitHub best practices:
1. Fork the repositories on GitHub. If you Clone, you won't have write
permission (as expected).
2. If you want to accept changes from upstream, you have to create a new pull
request to self by changing the base (first one) to your repo.
3. If you want to fetch a new branch from upstream, then create the new branch
and accept the changes as mentioned in #2 (where you will specify this new
branch as the base for accepting into).

BOSCH (Rahul Chandrashekar) asked for help in migrating their existing Java
Web App (Tomcat-based) to Bluemix. Got him started with this. Open questions:
1. How does framework call into the Java code? Earlier, there was a Resource
file alongside Web.xml which specified the Java classes.
2. BOSCH Web App, ICTeam has a dependency on MS Word libraries. How to
incorporate this on Bluemix? 

I have also created a PB-TinyJavaWebApp to try out various scenarios.
* Using this with Bluemix Tools - c:\Eclipse\tmp\eclipse2\bm1 from 
  c:\temp\nodeplay
* Also installed CF Tools cmd-line in C:\Utilities

In Eclipse IDE (tmp\eclipse2\bm1), was able to successfully deploy the app to
blluemix after making a change.

How can you use it with CF Tools CLI?
